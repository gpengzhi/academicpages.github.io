Here are the notes for `Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes`.

Introduction to Microservices
------

Modular; Easy to deploy; Scale independently

Microservices Design Pattern:

* Applies to Any Application

* Rapid Deployment

* Continuous Delivery

* Push Limits of Automation Tools

Microservices are one of the reasons we need advanced tools, like Kubernetes.

Twelve-Factor Apps (Best-practices for building deployable software-as-a-service apps)

* Portable

* Continually Deployable

* Scalable

[12factor.net](https://12factor.net/)

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Compact, self-contained method for transferring secure data as a JSON object.)

* Authentication

* Information Exchange

Building the Containers with Docker
------

Containers (Technology that makes it easy to run and distribute applications across different operating environments)

* Independent packages

* Namespace isolation

Dockerfile

<pre>
FROM alpine:3.1
MAINTAINER Kelsey Hightower <kelsey.hightower@gmail.com>
ADD hello /usr/bin/hello
ENTRYPOINT ["hello"]
</pre>

* Dockerfiles contain step-by-step instructions for creating Docker images

Kubernetes
------

Pods (Logical Application)

* One or more containers and volumes

* Shared namespaces

* One IP per pod

Pod can be created using pod configuration files, for example `monolith.yaml`

<pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: monolith
  labels:
    app: monolith
spec:
  containers:
    - name: monolith (This pod is made up of one container, monolith.)
      image: udacity/example-monolith:1.0.0
      args: (We are passing a few arguments to the container when it starts up.)
        - "-http=0.0.0.0:80"
        - "-health=0.0.0.0:81"
        - "-secret=secret"
      ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 80
        - name: health
          containerPort: 81
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 0.2
          memory: "10Mi"
</pre>
