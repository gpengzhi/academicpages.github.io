[CSE 599W: Systems for ML]() by Tianqi Chen, Haichen Shen, and Arvind Krishnamurthy at University of Washington.

[Lecture 1: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu/pdf/lecture1.pdf)

Not about Learning aspect of Deep Learning (except for the first two); System aspect of deep learning: faster training, efficient serving, lower memory consumption.

[Lecture 2: Components Overview of Deep Learning System](http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu/pdf/lecture3.pdf)

Typical Deep Learning System Stack

User API: Programming API; Gradient Calculation (Differentiation API)

System Components: Computational Graph Optimization and Execution; Runtime Parallel Scheduling

Architecture: GPU Kernels, Optimizing Device Code; Accelerators and Hardwares
