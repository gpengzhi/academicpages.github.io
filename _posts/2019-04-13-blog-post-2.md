[CSE 599W: Systems for ML]() by Tianqi Chen, Haichen Shen, and Arvind Krishnamurthy at University of Washington.

[Lecture 1: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu/pdf/lecture1.pdf)

Not about Learning aspect of Deep Learning (except for the first two); System aspect of deep learning: faster training, efficient serving, lower memory consumption.

[Lecture 3: Components Overview of Deep Learning System](http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu/pdf/lecture3.pdf)

Typical Deep Learning System Stack

User API: Programming API; Gradient Calculation (Differentiation API)

System Components: Computational Graph Optimization and Execution; Runtime Parallel Scheduling

Architecture: GPU Kernels, Optimizing Device Code; Accelerators and Hardwares

[Lecture 4: Backprop and Automatic Differentiation](http://dlsys.cs.washington.edu/pdf/lecture4.pdf)

Numerical differentiation

* Tool to check the correctness of implementation

Backpropagation

* Easy to understand and implement
* Bad for memory use and schedule optimization

Automatic differentiation

* Generate gradient computation to entire computation graph
* Better for system optimization
