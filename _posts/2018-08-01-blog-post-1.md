Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
======

Lecture 1: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition 
------

Increasing computation (CPUs, GPUs) + Relative large high quality dataset (ImageNet) ---> CNN works very well 

Lecture 2: Image Classification
------

We want classifiers that are fast at prediction; slow for training is ok.

L1 distance has coordinate dependency.

Cross-Validation is useful for small datasets, but not used too frequently in deep learning.

Lecture 3: Loss Functions and Optimization
------

\\[ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 \\]

Multi-class SVM Classification: Given an example (x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>) where x<sub>i</sub> is the image and where y<sub>i</sub> is the (integer) label, and using the shorthand for the scores vector: s = f(x<sub>i</sub>, W).

The SVM loss has the form:

L<sub>i</sub> = \sum_{j\neq}
