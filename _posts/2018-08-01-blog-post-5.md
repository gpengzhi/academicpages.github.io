Here are the notes for `Introduction to OpenStack`.

From Virtualization to Cloud Computing
------

In general, there are three important approaches when it comes to cloud computing:

* IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): an infrastructure that is used to provide virtual machines

* PaaS (Platform as a Service): the provider supplies the network, servers, storage, OS and middleware to host an application

* SaaS (Software as a Service): the provider gives access to an application.

OpenStack belongs to the IaaS cloud computing category.
