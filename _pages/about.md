I got my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](http://rpi.edu/), Department of Electrical, Computer & Systems Engineering under  the supervision of [Prof. Meng Wang](https://ecse.rpi.edu/~wang/). I obtained my M.S. in Electrical Engineering at [University of Pennsylvania (Penn)](http://www.upenn.edu/), and received my B.S. (with honors) in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in the intersection of the fields of signal processing, high-dimensional statistics, and machine learning.
